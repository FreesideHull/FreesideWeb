Welcome back to another blog post!

THis is a short post to announce that card access to the new Freeside room (next to LTD on the 3rd floor of the Robert Blackburn building - signs from the lift should direct you there!) should now be sorted! All students should now automatically have access to our room between 9am and 5pm. 24 hour access is being looked into and we will update you as soon as we hear anything!

If your card does not for whatever reason work on the Freeside door, please let us know in our [discord](https://invite.gg/freeside) and visit _Mark Bell_ at the DCS helpdesk (on your right going down the corridor from the lift on the 3rd floor of the Robert Blackburn building; open weekdays 2pm-4pm), who should be able to sort things out.
